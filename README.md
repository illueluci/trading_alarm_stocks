# trading_alarm_stocks

an attempt to apply what i learned from data science course from udemy

not intending for this to be easily spreadable to the public, just as a portofolio

If anyone uses this, i'm not responsible for anyone's financial decisions, the accuracy is trash lol (r squared only around ~0.1-0.2)
